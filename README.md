# KanjiLearner

A small Kanji Learning program in Python I wrote for my girlfriend.  
This is the source code and can be compiled into an exe using PyInstaller (found under https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).  
The program is CLI based and should be self explanatory.  
All of the Kanji and their meanings are saved to a JSON file, that is created by the user on startup.  
If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
