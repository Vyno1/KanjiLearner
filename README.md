# KanjiLearner

A small Kanji Learning program in Python I wrote for my girlfriend.
This is the source code and can be compiled into an exe using PyInstaller (found under https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).
The program is CLI based and should be self explanatory.
If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
